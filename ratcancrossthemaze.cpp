//the number of ways in which rat can cross the maze can be given by 
//the permutation and combination formula. that is by observing the 
//the patterns formed during the movement of the rat from one end to 
//the other.
//However that formula can't be applied if some cells of the maze or grid are blocked
// the formula is given by (m-1+n-1)/((m-1)!*(n-1)!)
// In most of the dp problem the implementation is really quite easy the most challenging 
// part is just come up with the recurrence relation thet will leads to form the answer.
